# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In the past, I have tried to study web development on my own and I was enjoying it, however, due to personal reasons, I wasn't able to continue my studies, so, now that I have the chance to do so, I want to be able to complete this achievement. I built this project to be able to have a guide to refer to throughout the bootcamp. It will help me throughout the course when I feel the need to revisit something and for debugging, for example. I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
